Smart Maps (“we,” “our,” or “us”) provides mapping and navigation services with optional in-app purchases. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information related to the use of our app.

1. Information Collection and Use

We do not collect, store, or share personally identifiable information (PII) by default. However, we reserve the right to collect anonymous usage data to improve our product.
	•	The app makes API calls to retrieve mapping and navigation data.
	•	We may collect usage statistics, error logs, and performance data to enhance the user experience.
	•	For users who purchase subscriptions or in-app items, Apple processes payments securely through the App Store.

2. Log Data

In case of app errors, we do not collect user-specific log data. However, Apple and third-party service providers may collect anonymized crash reports and analytics.

3. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions

Smart Maps offers optional in-app purchases and subscriptions. Payments are securely processed through Apple’s App Store, and we do not store payment details. Subscription information includes:
	•	Title: Smart MAps Plus
	•	Length: Monthly
	•	Price: $3.99/month
	•	Terms of Auto-Renewal: Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the renewal date. Users can manage their subscriptions in Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions.

4. Account Creation and Deletion

If your account creation is enabled, users will also have the ability to delete their account via the [Settings] page in the app. Deleting an account will result in the permanent removal of all associated user data.

5. Third-Party Services

Smart Maps may use third-party services (e.g., Apple APIs) that operate under their own privacy policies. These include:
	•	Apple App Store (for purchases)
	•	Apple Analytics (for anonymized app usage tracking)

6. Data Security

We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to any collected data.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Users will be notified via in-app notifications or app updates.
